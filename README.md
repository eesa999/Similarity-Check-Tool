# Similarity Check Tool

This project is a Python-based tool that utilizes the **Ollama AI model** to analyze **geographical and semantic similarity** between textual entries. It is designed to help determine whether two given texts refer to the same entity, name, or location, despite minor differences in wording.

## üìå Features

- Uses **AI-powered text similarity analysis** to detect equivalent names or entities.
- Processes data from **Excel files**.
- **Filters** and **matches** similar entries.
- Exports results in an Excel file for easy review.

## üöÄ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python** (>=3.7 recommended)

2. Required Python libraries:

   ```sh
   pip install pandas ollama openpyxl
   ```

3. **Install Ollama** (if not already installed):

   - For macOS and Linux:
     ```sh
     curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
     ```
   - For Windows:
     - Download the installer from [Ollama's official website](https://ollama.com) and follow the installation instructions.

4. **Verify Ollama installation**:

   ```sh
   ollama --version
   ```

   If this command returns a version number, Ollama is installed correctly.

5. **Download a model for use**:

   ```sh
   ollama run command-r7b-arabic
   ```

   You can use **any model** available on Ollama. Check the list of models at [Ollama's model search](https://ollama.com/search) and choose the one that best fits your needs.

6. **Excel files** (`trusted_file.xlsx` & `similarity_file.xlsx`)

   - Ensure the files contain the columns **`ID`** and **`NAME`**

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git https://github.com/eesa999/Similarity-Check-Tool.git
   cd similarity-check-tool
   ```

2. Place your input Excel files (`trusted_file.xlsx` & `similarity_file.xlsx`) in the same directory.

3. Run the script:

   ```sh
   python similarity_check.py
   ```

4. The processed results will be saved in:

   ```sh
   final_result.xlsx
   ```

---

## üîπ How It Works

1. **Loads** two Excel files (`trusted_file.xlsx` and `similarity_file.xlsx`).
2. **Creates a cross join** between them to compare all possible pairs.
3. **Applies AI-based text similarity** using the `check_similarity` function.
4. **Filters** the results to keep only the rows where similarity was confirmed.
5. **Saves** the final matched data into `final_result.xlsx`.

## üîπ Important Note

The `system_message` in the script has been updated to be more **generic**. Users must customize it to fit their **specific use case**, such as comparing product names, business entities, geographic locations, or other domain-specific needs. Modify the `system_message` content in the script as needed to align with your requirements.
